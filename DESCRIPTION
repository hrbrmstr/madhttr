Description: The 'httr', 'openssl', and 'HARtools' packages provide methods to retrieve
    rich metadata and content from internet hosts but their return objects are quite 
    unkempt. Methods are provided to turn these objects into tidy data frames along with
    other useful helper methods which augment functionality in these packages.
